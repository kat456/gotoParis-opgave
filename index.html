                    <p>Paris is beautiful both where it’s grand, like in the city’s heart near the Eiffel Tower, and where it’s intimate, like along Montmartre’s cobblestoned streets.</p>
                    <p>The skyline is protected by UNESCO and buildings can’t be more than six stories tall, so there’s no part of the city with an obscured view.</p>
                    <p>Paris is relatively small and the streets are extra-wide, making it the perfect city for strolling hand-in-hand.</p>
